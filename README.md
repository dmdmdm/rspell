# rspell
A non-interactive spell checker with suggestions using only `/usr/share/dict/words` -- emulates ispell and aspell

Other spell checkers are huge beasts.  But this one is pretty small.
It just uses `/usr/share/dict/words` which is available on all Linux systems.

Here's what happens when you check a correctly spelled word and an incorrectly spelled word:

```
$ echo apple orrange | ./rspell
@(#) International Ispell Version 3.1.20 (but really rspell .1)
*
& orrange 6 6: arrange, cornage, orange, oranger, oranges, orangey
```

You get pretty much the same thing from big aspell:
```
$ echo apple orrange | aspell -a
@(#) International Ispell Version 3.1.20 (but really Aspell 0.60.8)
*
& orrange 13 6: Orange, orange, arrange, arranger, or range, or-range, oranges, range, arranged, arranges, grange, Orange's, orange's
```

The output from these spell-checkers is intended to be used by another program -- like a word processor.

Compiles and works on Linux and Windows (VC++).
But on Windows you need to supply a word file.
